# YouTube-Sentiment-Analysis

Script that performs sentiment analysis on YouTube video comments using the TextBlob API and generates a graphical display showing whether video is positive or negative based on user comments. This script is one component of a larger project that analyzes YouTube video frames, audio, and metadata to classify videos as malicious. Project is currently in progress and is being overseen by Fortinet.
